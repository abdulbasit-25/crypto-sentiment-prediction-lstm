# Crypto Sentiment Prediction using NLP & LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting cryptocurrency market sentiment using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, with a primary emphasis on **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks. The goal is to analyze crypto-related textual data and classify sentiment as **Positive, Neutral, or Negative**, helping identify early market signals driven by public opinion.

## 📊 Problem Motivation
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced more by **public sentiment, media narratives, and investor psychology** than traditional economic indicators. Rapid emotional reactions such as fear and greed often cause sudden price fluctuations.

This project aims to build an AI-based sentiment analysis system that can:
- Quantify market emotions
- Detect early trend shifts
- Support data-driven crypto market insights

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Sentiment Classification:** Categorize crypto-related text into Positive, Neutral, or Negative  
- **NLP + ML Integration:** Apply NLP techniques with machine learning and deep learning models  
- **Trend Analysis:** Correlate sentiment trends with cryptocurrency market behavior

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 81% |
| SVM | 85% |
| **LSTM (Final Model)** | **91%** |

The LSTM model demonstrated superior performance due to its ability to capture contextual and sequential patterns in text data.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Implement transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa)  
- Integrate real-time data from Twitter and Reddit APIs  
- Develop a web dashboard for live sentiment visualization  
- Deploy as a real-time market sentiment monitoring system  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence can transform unstructured textual data into actionable financial insights**. With 91% accuracy, the sentiment prediction model effectively captures early indicators of market behavior driven by public sentiment.
